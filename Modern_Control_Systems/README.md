# Modern-Control-Theory-Design

## Project Overview

The project is structured into two main parts, each focusing on critical aspects of control theory applied to a specific system. Below is a detailed breakdown of each part, including their sub-components.

### Part 1: Linearization and PID Control Design

This part deals with the linearization of the system and the design of PID controllers for both longitudinal and lateral control mechanisms.

- **1.1 Linearization of the System**
  - The process involves approximating the nonlinear system dynamics with a linear model around a nominal operating point.
- **1.2 Design of PID Controller for Longitudinal Control**
  - Development and tuning of a PID controller to manage the longitudinal dynamics of the system.
- **1.3 Design of PID Controller for Lateral Control**
  - Development and tuning of a PID controller to manage the lateral dynamics of the system.

### Part 2: Controllability, Stabilizability, and State Feedback Control

This part focuses on assessing the controllability and stabilizability of the linearized system and designing a lateral full-state feedback controller.

- **2.1 Check Controllability of the Linearized System**
  - Examination of the system's controllability properties to ensure that the state variables can be fully controlled.
- **2.2 Check Stabilizability of the Linearized System**
  - Analysis of the system's stabilizability to determine if unstable poles can be stabilized with feedback.
- **2.3 Design of Lateral Full-State Feedback Controller**
  - Design and implementation of a full-state feedback controller to manage the lateral dynamics effectively.
